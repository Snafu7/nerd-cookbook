# Hamburgers

A hamburger. An absolute American classic (hails from a German dish that was basically a patty by itself).

Now, this one uses beef. Since beef has a huge environmental footprint, should be eaten sparingly (red meat isn’t great
for you either due to the trans fats contained therein). Therefore, let’s make the most out of it.

Now, burgers are pretty customisable, so I will speak of good toppings; however, the recipe will be what I’d consider
a ‘classic’ gourmet cheeseburger.

### Meat

Note: all these apply to non-beef mixes, or weird mixes. If you want a veal + beef burger, follow the ratio guidelines and you’ll be fine. Just check
how lean your meat is, and remember: pork is danger.

First off, in meat, the most important thing is a good fat to meat ratio. You want 20/80ish. The second most important part is the quality of
the cuts you make the mince out of. This throws most pre-ground meat out of the window - 
the ratios are a crapshoot (despite what the label says), and you never know what you get, so you’re gonna buy an actual steak.

Additionally, you *want* to have ‘pockets’ of fat. Therefore, cuts where marbling is visible and with some fat on it are great; cuts with
fat distributed throughout aren’t.

Good options:

 * Well marbled rib-eye - a good butcher will give you the bone, too, we will use that. This *can* be too lean, so get something
   with a bunch of fat visible.
 * short rib - a classic, for a reason.
 * chuck steak - an ordinarily tough (aka cheap) cut that works great in a burger.

Really bad options:
 * tenderloin. Never grind up the loin (well... of a cow, anyway). It’s a beautifully tender cut without much marbling. Wasted in a burger.

### Preparing the meat

There are many ways to prepare meat. First is to ask the butcher to grind it up. A decent option if you’re lazy, but they will probably
use a regular temperature grinder. This will lead to smearing of the fat in the mince, which leads to ‘drying out’ of the burger, and makes it seize up
and become slightly unpleasant.

Another option is to use a blender. This is a decent option, but again, it will lead to smearing of the fat.

The best ‘lazy’ option is to use your own meat grinder. Put the grinding attachments into the freezer for 2 hours prior to mincing, and
put the meat alongside for 20 minutes just before mincing. The lower temperature will minimise smearing.

That being said, my preferred option is to hand-chop the meat. First off, it will lead to minimal amount of smearing, which is good.
Second of all, the chunks won’t be uniform. This in turn makes for a more interesting texture. If you do it right, you get a meaty burger
that dissolves in your mouth, but still retains a bite; with pockets of delicious juice enhancing the experience. Finally, it is the most
hygienic method, which will allow you to cook your meat rare if you want. This is the method I will describe in the recipe.

### Making the patty

We’re not gonna use a binder. Now, I’m not American, so I don’t get my nipples in a twist if someone does. That said, you can do it
without, so why mask the flavor of your awesome beef? If you bought pre-ground at the store, feel free to use some egg for the binder. Do not
use flour - if you leave even the slightest bit of pink in the burger, you will get raw flour. Raw flour is terrible.

Make the patty as thick as you want, but without a binder, there is a maximum thickness that’s tenable. Think of a standard ‘gourmet’ burger
at your favorite place and how thick the patty is. It’s that thick for a reason. Let’s say 1.5-2cm is your limit.

Without a binder, you might need to ‘smush’ the mince a little. Contrary to popular belief, it is actually quite hard to overwork
meat with your hands, so don’t be afraid to use a little strength a few times. That being said, your touch should mostly be light and you shouldn’t rush
the forming of the patty so that you don’t lead to smearing that we wanted to avoid so much.

And for the final tip: make a ‘well’ shape of a few millimeters on one side of the patty (the one that will be on top when you put
the patty in the pan). Slightly thicker edges will mean that after cooking renders some of the fat, you will be left with an uniform
shape on both sides.

### Buns

A brioche bun is great. But if you don’t have it, any wheat roll from a bakery will do.

Toast the bun, always.

### Toppings

You basically want things that accentuate umami flavors.

For solid toppings:
 * Tomatoes contain a lot of MSG (monosodium glutamate). They work perfectly, and are a classic for a reason.
 * Cheese contains a lot of MSG. That said, you want something that melts readily - parmegiano regiano has the most
   MSG from cheeses but it doesn’t work too well. It could be an idea to add a little sprinkling of that, but the bulk
   should be a melty cheese. American, tasteless as it is, actually works ok for that reason. But go for Munster or
   a smoked Gouda. Cheddar also works in a pinch. Mozarella is melty enough but very mild. Finally, if you want to go
   super fancy, Chevre is what you should go for. It’s brilliant with beef, but it tastes so fancy it might put people off.
   As always, local alternatives can work great and are usually way cheaper.
 * Mushrooms are an excellent complement to meaty flavors.
 * Onions accentuate MSG in other foods, another classic.
 * A hot pepper brings out every other taste, and is a good addition.
 * Bacon. C’mon.
 * Lettuce. Adds freshness. Calling it a ‘topping’ is a misnomer; put the lettuce underneath your burger patty. If you put it above, it will wilt. If you
   put it below, it will protect the bun from juice spillage.

For liquid toppings:
 * Ketchup is concentrated MSG from tomatoes. It works. An American will kill you, but fuck those assholes if they can’t take a joke, right?
 * Mayonnaise is a complement to the beef flavor. Another thing an American will kill you for. So I will mix both.
 * Mustard is too strong to use alone, but a small dash works.
 * Worcestershire sauce is MSG in form of liquid, basically. Good idea.
 * BBQ sauce is another strong flavor, but it can work, especially if you’re cooking on the grill (we won’t be, but it’s an option)
 * A small dash of honey can accentuate the flavors of meat.

And finally, for spices:
 * Salt accentuates meaty flavors.
 * Pepper belongs on basically everything savoury.
 * Ajinomoto/crystal MSG. Your secret weapon, and the biggest enhancer of umami you can find.

Comedy option: make a peanut butter + banana + beef + bacon burger. Just like Elvis would have wanted. (It’s actually quite legit! But not a classic way to
have a hamburger).

# Recipe for a ‘classic’ cheeseburger

### Ingredients

Makes a wildly unhealthy, and wildly flavourful meal for two.

For patty, bun and toppings:
* 300g of bone-in rib-eye, and 250g of chuck. Not pre-ground. With refuse discarded, will make two ~220g burgers.
* Two buns.
* A medium/large red onion, cut in a very specific way: cut off root and stem. Cut off two thick slices of onion rings, followed by two thin slices of onion ring, followed by dicing the
  rest of the onion.
* A large tomato.
* A few leaves of lettuce.
* A jalapeno, or a different hot pepper.
* Salt
* Pepper
* Ajinomoto (crystal MSG). It’s fine. No studies have ever shown it to be more unhealthy than salt itself.
* Vegetable fat, and butter.
* Your chosen, melty cheese - 2 thin slices.

For dressing:
* one and a half tablespoons of mayo
* one and a half tablespoon of ketchup (I have a spicy, fancy ketchup I like using here)
* 2 dashes of worcestershire sauce
* aaaand be creative. You got a bit of a spice relish that you’re not using too much? Add it in! As long as the bulk of
  the sauce is mayo/ketchup, it’s gonna work just fine and add a neat note to the burger.
  Best options are a very hot salsa (salsa verde with habanero is great) and something with sweetness, like a classic sweet relish.

### Instructions

Prepare your sauce. Mix all the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Reserve.

Prepare your meat. Put the steaks in the freezer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, bring out of the freezer, and cut in thin strips (cut off the bone with the excess fat and marrow,
and also cut off any silver skin you find. Reserve the bone + fat). Put back in the freezer for
5 more minutes, then begin chopping. Use a very sharp blade - first cut across the strips thinly so you get a sort-of-elongated dice, then use the standard
‘one hand on the handle, and one hand on top of a good, sharp blade’ technique. Go in a criss-cross 3 or 4 times, at which point you will achieve a consistency of
a rough mince. [If you need a demonstration, this is basically kinda what you want to do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-M6RxZya4Y)

Form your patties to desired thickness, with the edges slightly thicker, as described. Wrap and put into the *fridge* for 5 mins to firm up slightly, so they are easier
to cook without falling apart. After you take them out, just before putting on the pan, season with a bunch of salt, pepper, and a bit of ajinomoto on both sides.

Toast your buns in butter - first cut the buns, melt a tablespoon or two of butter in a heated pan, and toast the buns until nice and golden brown. Reserve.

If you have reserved your bone and marrow, now is the time to render some of the fat you will have on the side of the bone. Put it in a somewhat hot pan for a few minutes. After fat is rendered, take out the refuse, and discard.
Add enough vegetable oil with a high smoke point (like grapeseed oil) to the fat for cooking your patties, and crank the heat up high.

Once pan and oil is very hot, place your seasoned patty in the pan. You want a strong frying noise, so you get caramelisation. At the same time, put slices of the hot pepper of your choice, and the thick slices
of onion rings near the patty, using the same fat. This will help the flavors ‘marry’ a little, and mellow out the pepper and cook the rawness of the onion out.

Before you flip the patty, put the thin slice of onion on top of each patty (this will caramelise very deeply, and impart yet another flavor). Take the peppers and thick onion out (they should have caramelised by the time you need to flip), and reserve.
Flip the patty when you think you’re about halfway through the cooking. This depends on a lot of factors, so you’ll have to use your own experience here. After flipping, put
a slice of cheese on top of each of the patties.

Cook on the other side until your desired doneness is reached (I like medium rare or medium for burgers). You also want a good caramelised crust, without being burnt.  Again, this is
only learned by experience. 4 minutes a side is a good starting point.

Now, to assemble the burger. Take the bottom of the bun, spread your topping with a spoon liberally. By liberally I mean ‘a bunch’, not ‘complain while you do it’. Put a leaf of lettuce
on the bottom bun. Put your cooked patty, cheese up, on the lettuce. Put tomato slices, cooked hot pepper, cooked onion, and some of the dice of raw onion on top (as you can see, we have treated the onion
in three different ways, and each one gives it’s own goodness to the dish. Making the most of a single ingredient is a pro move!). Finally, put some of
the sauce on your top bun (if you want to add a dash of the ‘strong’ liquid flavors, like mustard or BBQ sauce, this is where to do it), and close the lid.

Wait 2-3 minutes for the meat to rest a bit, so you avoid rawness in the center, and the temperature gets perfect. For plating, cut in half with a sharp blade, so that the cross-section is clearly visible. Excess sauce
can be served alongside in a small bowl, for dipping. Serve with french fries, onion rings, or by itself; accompany with a refreshing drink, like beer, coca-cola, or water. Don’t put any
fucking wine near this thing. Enjoy. :)
