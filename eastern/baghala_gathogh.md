# Baghala gathogh

Baghala gathogh is a very simple staple Persian dish. Good with frozen fava beans, great with fresh.

It uses the humble egg as sauce! Very economical, and actually quite healthy.

You can use your variety of herbs, but dill works best.

Note: this is actually a simplified version of the classic dish. The classic dish does a bigger song and dance and is more of a stew.
I think this is a better take on the dish, and muuuch simpler.

### Ingredients

I eat this much as a single portion, but if you want a light meal, this will make a portion for two.

* 250g of fava beans. Let rest under warmish water for 10 mins if frozen.
* 2 cloves of garlic, chopped or sliced.
* 6 dill stalks (basically, a bunch), chopped finely. Other fresh green herb works.
* half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of turmeric.
* a pinch of saffron, crushed in a mortar and mixed with a few tablespoons of hot water - this will make the most
  out of this expensive spice. If that’s too rich for your blood (it actually might be the most expensive ingredient here), use more turmeric instead.
* salt, pepper
* olive oil for frying
* some butter
* 2 medium eggs.

### Instructions

Heat olive oil on medium heat. Add garlic, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Fry until garlic softens a little, about 1-2 minutes.

Add the fava beans (optionally, if you don’t want to eat or fight the skins as much, you can make incisions in the skin beforehand). Add
the saffron water. Pepper and salt - yes, again. It’s a spice oriented dish, so you’re gonna add it at many stages. Fry up for 5 minutes.

Add most of the dill. If most of the saffron water already evaporated, add some more warm water to the pan. You want it to get close to dry only
once fava beans are soft, about 5-10 minutes.

Add butter, wait until it melts. Make two ‘wells’ in the beans, and crack an egg into each well. Salt, pepper, and sprinkle the
rest of the dill. Fry until egg becomes a sunny side up egg,
with set white but runny yolk. The runny yolk is the star - you can puncture it on the plate and use as a sauce!

Serve with rye bread.
