# Aglio e olio

One of the simplest dishes you can do. A lesson in making
the most of your ingredients.

We will do this one science style straight on. I consider this
method of preparation to be the best, and while the stuff
I will tell you to do is not unheard of in Italy, it is certainly
unorthodox.

Fret not, though, Italians in the audience - this recipe uses ONLY
the classical ingredients, in classical amounts. I don't think you
will be disappointed.

### Ingredients

Measurements per person. Makes an elegant and light dinner.

* 100-125g of dry pasta. Use spaghetti, regular - whole wheat can work
  but is inferior. Do not use fresh pasta - the egg in the mixture
  will clash with the olive oil that forms the bulk of the sauce and the starchy pasta. You wouldn't
  put mayonaisse on pasta, right? Same principle. Fresh pastas are for dishes
  with sweetness and acidity to them to cut through the richness - so a pasta
  with a pure tomato sauce would be a good candidate. Here, you want the texture
  and the starchiness of dry pasta.
* 2-3 tablespoons of the finest extra virgin olive oil you can get. While I usually prefer
  Spanish olive oil's flavor profile, Italian works best here, as you want something
  robust and with panache. 
* ~2-ish cloves of garlic, carefully peeled and then sliced as thin as your knife skills allow. 
  Do not mash it. Do not crush it. Do not dice it. Every single one of these will change
  the flavor profile of the garlic. You want thin slices. You also want garlic
  that is fresh and with flavor - get something organic, and local. If you see that
  the core of the clove of garlic is starting to green, it's gonna make this dish worse.
  If it's nice and nearly white, it's gonna be amazing. You can add more or less of the garlic,
  depending on how garlicy you like your food.
* 1 clove of garlic, unpeeled.
* 2 small (3-4 cm long, thin) hot red peppers, deseeded by cutting off the top,
  rolling the pepper between your hands, and then sliced into thin rings. 
  The hotness is key to this dish, and the red color is important. You want a small pepper
  fitting those criteria. Beyond that, it's your choice. 
  Remember that the hotness is gonna get spread in the oil (capsaicin is oil-soluble) - so
  don't be afraid to use something on the spicy side! The combo with oil and garlic will
  smooth out the hotness and turn it into a pleasant and balanced experience. For
  this reason, I recommend peri-peri for heat lovers (my preference), or cayenne if 
  you want something more mild but with a kick. You can go milder if you want but I do
  recommend you give it a try with something that's on the edge of your tolerance in other
  dishes.
* A few sprigs of fresh parsley - a few whole, and a few chopped. Ideally, get it 
  freshly picked from a plant in a pot. I cannot overstate how important the quality of 
  every single ingredient is in this dish.
* Water and salt.

### Instructions

We're gonna use the risottare la pasta method - the same I used in [cacio e pepe](cacio_e_pepe.md).
It will make for a wonderful, glossy sauce. But we're gonna go a step further and adjust the method
to kick it up another notch.

Bring a bunch of water to a boil in a boiling pan. Now, this is a key moment. Add salt - but not as
much as usually recommended to pasta water. Around a teaspoon of sea salt will suffice. The
risotto-like method means more salt will lead to your dish tasting like the walls of a salt mine! I've made
this mistake before.

In addition, add the whole sprigs of parsley, the unpeeled garlic clove, and (if you want) a whole another
pepper to this. We're making a light broth which will infuse our pasta with flavor on the inside! The reason I 
say pepper is optional is because most of the flavor in chili peppers is not water soluble - still, it doesn't
hurt, so you can.

While our broth is infusing with parsley and garlic, we're gonna infuse the oil.

Heat a very large nonstick frying pan (low heat). Pour the olive oil into it, and add your sliced peppers and 
garlic. Now, slowly heat the oil up, until the garlic starts sizzling. This is where you have to be very careful
with the dish - fry it up taking off and back on the heat, carefully, at a light sizzle, for a couple minutes. 
What you're looking for is for the garlic to turn blond, but not brown. Brown means bitterness, blond means infusion.
So, be careful, take it slow, and take off the heat once ready. Reserve the oil with everything for later in a bowl.

Clean and reheat the same frying pan (low to medium heat).  Put the dry pasta into a completely dry pan. Take a
ladle or two of your boiling parsley broth, just enough to cover the pasta.

Now, don’t go anywhere. Wait until the pasta gets slightly pliable, adding broth as necessary to keep it covered. 
Once it becomes pliable, start and keep flipping and/or stirring it. If the water evaporates too much, add a little 
more of your boiling broth, just to cover the pasta.  Do not add too much. Keep stirring and flipping while doing 
this to extract the starch from the pasta. What you will get is very starchy and airy water that will look anything 
between bubbly thin milk and boiling wallpaper paste. This is what you’re looking for. Watch out - the water is so 
starchy, it can literally burn if you try to reduce it too much, much like a roux!

Essentially, treat the pasta exactly like a risotto. This process is called ‘risottare la pasta’.

Keep tasting the pasta until it’s almost al dente, with some but not too much starchy water left in the pan. 
When it is, add back your oil and chili slices, being careful to discard the garlic slices 
(they've done their job, and are now mushy and unpleasant, while the chili slices still provide color).

Stir and mix vigorously for 20 seconds, turn off the heat, add the chopped parsley, and continue stirring for another minute. The
super-concentrated starch in the water will emulsify with the oil, and make a cohesive, silky, glossy sauce
that should cling to the pasta strands.

(Side note: you could make the oil alongside the pasta. It's hard, but it can be done. If you do it that way,
your oil will be hot, so you can turn off the heat immediately when adding back the oil. That said, it's a lot easier like this.)

Serve by taking a carving fork and twirling the pasta around it, then putting it onto a pan to form a
Vesuvius like shape. If any sauce is remaining in the pan (there won’t be), pour it over the pasta.
For presentation, you can put a whole red pepper somewhere on the side of the pasta. But don't
overthink this one, if you followed this recipe, your pasta will be glossy with a subtle, lovely olive-y color, with 
spots of vibrant greens and reds from the parsley and the pepper. Minimalist beauty in a nutshell - adding would take away.

Pair with a simple Italian white dry wine, and enjoy. :)
