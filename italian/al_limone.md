# Pasta al limone 

Another triumph of simplicity. I much prefer [aglio e olio](aglio_e_olio.md)
to it in that category, but if you don't have excellent quality
olive oil, this might be a better choice, as it's somewhat less
reliant on ingredient quality.

While we're on topic... a lot of people make aglio with lemon, which
is a silly idea because aglio does not need any acidity, and in fact,
it cuts through the flavor of olive oil and garlic that is built in aglio
e olio (the pepper is there to add heat, which enhances the comparatively
mild flavors). By contrast, here we use butter and cut through it with lemon
to create a fresh and light, almost dessert like pasta.

### Ingredients

Measurements per person. Makes an elegant and light dinner.

* 100-125g of pasta. Use linguine if possible, and yes, this means fresh pasta
  is on the docket if you want! That said I think the texture from dry is better, but you can do
  whichever (the risottare la pasta method will not work with fresh pasta). Also, you can use regular
  spaghetti for a weeknight dinner. Use slightly more butter if you do.
* A big knob of butter. We're talking 2 tablespoons if not more.
* Half of a lemon. To be precise, you want to use a big lemon per two portions.
* A few sprigs of fresh parsley - a few whole, and a few chopped. Ideally, get it 
  freshly picked from a plant in a pot. 
* Water and salt.
* (optional but recommended) A little bit of olive oil. This is just to make the butter lighter.
* (optional but recommended) Half a clove of garlic, sliced in thin slices.
* (optional but recommended) A bit of grated parmesan or pecorino romano.

### Instructions

Prepare your lemon. Wash, take off a slice of the peel, like making a lemon twist. Zest the rest of the lemon,
careful not to take off the white pith with it. Cut the lemon in half, take off a very thin slice per portion
for decoration, and finally juice and strain the lemon into a separate container.

We're gonna use the risottare la pasta method - the same I used in other pasta recipes. 
It will make for a wonderful, glossy sauce. 

Bring a bunch of water to a boil in a boiling pan. Now, this is a key moment. Add salt - but not as
much as usually recommended to pasta water. Around a teaspoon of sea salt will suffice. 

In addition, add the whole sprigs of parsley, and the lemon twist to the water. This will make the water a light,
fragrant broth.

While our broth is infusing with parsley and lemon, we're gonna infuse the oil.

Heat a very large nonstick frying pan (low heat). Pour a bit of olive oil into it, add the garlic. Bring it juuust
to a slight sizzle, add cold butter, lemon juice, and most of the lemon zest. Melt the butter, and heat it stirring
until it juuust starts to sing a little. It is ready for use. Ideally, you want to do this alongside the pasta,
but you can also do it beforehand and reserve.

Clean and reheat the same frying pan (low to medium heat).  Put the dry pasta into a completely dry pan. Take a
ladle or two of your boiling parsley broth, just enough to cover the pasta.

Now, don’t go anywhere. Wait until the pasta gets slightly pliable, adding broth as necessary to keep it covered. 
Once it becomes pliable, start and keep flipping and/or stirring it. If the water evaporates too much, add a little 
more of your boiling broth, just to cover the pasta.  Do not add too much. Keep stirring and flipping while doing 
this to extract the starch from the pasta. What you will get is very starchy and airy water that will look anything 
between bubbly thin milk and boiling wallpaper paste. This is what you’re looking for. Watch out - the water is so 
starchy, it can literally burn if you try to reduce it too much, much like a roux!

Essentially, treat the pasta exactly like a risotto. This process is called ‘risottare la pasta’.

Keep tasting the pasta until it’s almost al dente, with some but not too much starchy water left in the pan. 
When it is, add back your oil/lemon mixture, being careful to discard the mushy garlic slices.

Stir and mix vigorously for 20 seconds, turn off the heat, add the chopped parsley, and continue stirring for another minute. The
super-concentrated starch in the water will emulsify with the oil, and make a cohesive, silky, glossy sauce
that should cling to the pasta strands.

Serve as a Vesuvius shape. New method: grab the pasta with your tongs, then slowly lower it from up high while twirling the
plate. You'll get the nest correct this way! Dust with the remaining zest, the cheese, and put the reserved slice of lemon on
the side.

You could probably pair this with anything that goes with seafood, so a white wine will work good. Enjoy. :)
