# Cacio e pepe

Cheese and pepper pasta. One of the staples of Italian cuisine.

It’s very important, chiefly because it’s delicious, and making
it right teaches you how to make all pastas right. In addition,
adding extra ingredients makes other dishes. Adding guanciale
(Italian bacon) makes pasta alla gricia; adding tomatoes to that
gets you amatriciana; and adding egg yolks to gricia gets you the
lovely pasta alla carbonara.

First, to pay our dues, follows the classic recipe for cacio e pepe.

### Classic cacio el pepe

Measurements per person. Makes an elegant and filling first dish, or a light dinner.

* 100-125g of dry spaghetti. Originally tonnarelli or bucatini, but regular works.
* 50g of finely, freshly grated Pecorino Romano.
* a bunch of freshly cracked black pepper.

### Instructions

Boil pasta until al dente as instructed on the packet, a litre of heavily salted water per 100g of pasta.

Just before pasta is ready, onto a heated frying pan, dump some of the pasta water. Crack in black pepper, toast for a moment.
The starch in the water will help emulsify the cheese and make a cohesive sauce.

Add pasta to the pan, no need to rinse it. In fact, it’d be a mistake. Add the cheese. Stir until melted and incorporated.

Serve.

# How to anger an Italian

Did you notice that we didn’t add a thickening agent like butter or (god forbid) cream? That’s because both those things will cut through the
flavor of the cheese. However, without a thickening agent, the only thing making the sauce stick instead of split from the pasta is the starch.
In addition, this is actually shockingly easy to screw up. The cheese has a tendency to split anyway, leaving you with a disgusting mess made
of regret. Hence, most people cheat by adding butter as an emulsifier at the start of this recipe. I contend this is still acceptable. Cream is not.

But there’s a better way.

Therefore, let’s get molecular gastronomy on this recipe. Here’s how to make restaurant quality cacio e pepe easily.

### Ingredients

Measurements per person. Makes an elegant and filling first dish, or a light dinner.

* 100-125g of dry pasta. I actually would opt for regular spaghetti
  over the slightly different and hard to get ‘classics’. If possible, get one that has a slightly
  rough texture, as this will promote exchange of starch with the water.
  But regular spaghetti works just as well.
* 50 g of finely, freshly grated cheese. Use your imagination. I like a 50/50 split of Pecorino Romano and Parmegiano Regiano.
  But any easily melting hard cheese(s) will work, and especially a sheep’s milk hard cheese. Using local replacements
  can be an interesting and cheaper alternative.
* a bunch of whole pepper kernels. Here, you want quality. It will make for a better dish,
  and black pepper is so ubiquitous it’s a good investment anyhow. You could also use other
  types of pepper if you desired, but black is always in style.

### Instructions

Bring a bunch of *lightly* salted water to a boil in a boiling pan. The exact amount doesn’t matter but 0.5l per 100g will make
sure you have way more than enough.

Heat a very large nonstick frying pan (low to medium heat). Put the pepper kernels in, no oil or liquid. Toast them off for a couple minutes. This will enhance their flavor,
add caramel notes to the taste, and improve the texture so that you can bite into it with a crunch and without excessive hotness, allowing
you to crack the pepper more coarsely and add texture to the dish. After the kernels are nicely toasted (they will turn lighter and slightly glossy from the
released residual oils), reserve in a mortar. Do not crack them yet.

Reheat the same frying pan (low to medium heat). Put the dry pasta into a completely dry pan. Take a ladle or two of your boiling water, just enough
to cover the pasta.

Now, don’t go anywhere. Wait until the pasta gets slightly pliable, adding water as necessary to keep it covered. Once it becomes pliable,
start and keep flipping and/or stirring it. If the water evaporates too much, add a little more of your boiling water, just to cover the pasta.
Do not add too much. Keep stirring and flipping while doing this. What you will get is very starchy and airy water that will look anything between bubbly thin milk and
boiling wallpaper paste. This is what you’re looking for. Watch out - the water is so starchy, it can literally burn if you try to reduce it too much, much like a roux!

Essentially, treat the pasta exactly like a risotto. This process is called ‘risottare al pasta’.

Keep tasting the pasta until it’s almost al dente. When it is, take a few spoonfuls of the starchy water, and mix it with the grated cheese in a bowl.
This will temper the cheese so it doesn’t split when you add it to the pasta. Crush the kernels roughly in a mortar. Add about two thirds
of the pepper to the cheese mixture, and reserve the rest. Go back to the frying pan.

When pasta reaches al dente (it will in total take a few minutes longer than the regular way), you want to have a little, but not very much liquid left
in the pan. Add the cheesy starchy peppery mix, and stir it in vigorously until it forms a cohesive sauce. You know it’s good when it looks like
liquid silk and sticks to the pasta, completely covering it.

Serve by taking a carving fork and twirling the pasta around it, then putting it onto a pan to form a Vesuvius like shape. Give up because this shit is hard
to do and just dump it on the plate the first couple of times you try this. If any sauce is remaining in the pan (there won’t be), pour it over the pasta.
Sprinkle a little more of the pepper and a few bits of extra grated cheese on top. If, say, making a romantic dinner for two (or more than two, I’m not your mom),
a pro move is to serve the remainder of the pepper still in the mortar tableside, for the participants to freely add some extra.

Pair with a simple Italian white (ex. Orvieto or Vermentino) or red (ex. Chianti Classico) wine. Enjoy. :)

# Spaghetti alla gricia

### Ingredients

As in the cacio e pepe, and (per person):
* 70g guanciale, which is pork jowl bacon-type product. Pancetta is allowed, and reasonable Italians will also accept
  regular bacon in places guanciale is hard to find. Unfortunately, there are no reasonable Italians, so don’t do that in front of one.

### Instructions

Put guanciale in the freezer for 20 minutes. This will make it easier to handle, as it’s nearly pure fat. Cut into thin strips.
Cubes also work, but strips are superior.

Heat up non-stick pan on basically your weakest burner. Let the guanciale stew low and slow until you render a bunch of the fat.
After 10 minutes of this, crank the heat up. Crisp up the guanciale to your desired level of caramelisation. I recommend leaving
it a little soft, but you do you.

Reserve *only* the chunks of guanciale in a small bowl, and the fat (of which there will be quite a lot, perhaps three tablespoons)
in a separate bowl.

Treat pepper, cheese and pasta the same way as in cacio e pepe done the ‘risottare al pasta’ method. Just before pasta is cooked,
add in the fat, mixing vigorously. When pasta is done, add in cheese, pepper, and most of the guanciale. Mix until a velvety sauce
forms. Serve by topping with the guanciale in addition to the pepper and cheese leftovers.

Yes, guanciale is really that fat. Why the hell do you think it’s so good?

# Spaghetti alla amatriciana

### Ingredients

As in alla gricia, and (per person):
* 2 tomatoes.

### Instructions

Cut your tomatoes in quarters, then cut out the core and the seeds, leaving a shape like a bell pepper you’d cut in strips.

Cut the tomato ‘shell’ in thin strips. Like a bell pepper you’d cut in strips.

Treat everything else as in spaghetti alla gricia, except after removing the guanciale from the fat, add in the tomato strips
and cook for a few minutes. Reserve the tomatoes along with the fat, and add back just like before. Serve as above, except if
you are feeling fancy top with a few cherry tomatoes on the vine.

### Nutricion

Same as above. Don’t be the dude who counts the nutrition in a goddamn tomato.

# Spaghetti alla carbonara

### Ingredients

As in alla gricia, and (per person):
* yolk and 0.25 of the white from a single egg. Strictly speaking you can use just the yolk, but the white helps aerate the mixture
  and make the dish slightly lighter. Carbonara is a very heavy dish.

### Instructions

Treat guanciale as in alla gricia.

This time, you will need to do some more finagling with the cheese and eggs. This mixture likes to split and make a disgusting mess,
so you will temper it more thoroughly.

Toast pepper as normal. Crack early (don’t want to multitask this one). Mix with the cheese and the yolk + albumen, preferably in a large
glass or metal bowl. Put the bowl over your boiling water - you want to employ a double burner setup as if you were melting chocolate - and
start whipping the mixture together vigorously. The slight heat from the steam will help it SLIGHTLY melt and mix into a cohesive structure. 
Do not leave the bowl over the water for any longer than necessary, you do not want to cook the mixture. Reserve. During cooking the pasta,
you can also additionally temper by adding some of the starchy water and whipping it together - again, don’t overdo this. You do not want to
cook it.

Treat pasta as normal. Add your guanciale fat before pasta is ready. When pasta is ready, take off the heat and mix in your cheese/egg/pepper
mixture. Mix vigorously until a silky sauce forms. Serve similarly to alla gricia.
